PhP is not that great. It is outdated, and latest php versions are still miles behind modern times. Regardless of what php lovers spew on youtube videos that make you stupider-, php is not secure. Several well known hackers have repeatedly stated that php apps are easy to hack. This repo is just screwing around with php 8.4.8+. The apps are meant as a starter kit to get you going. Feed any of the apps to ai, have it audit the code and make any changes you want. 

The apps here are NOT SECURE. It would be incredibly foolish to think a php app is secure.
